HOW DOES THE WEB WORK:
When we click on a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it will locate the resources.

Browser -> Servers
This is a client-server model.
The browser requests, and the server validates and then gives a response.
The request is formatted in the form of HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol).

Example:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1  
Host: www.random.com  
Status Codes:
1xx – Informational Response (These status codes are all about the information received by the server when a request is made).
2xx – Success (This status code depicts that the request made has been fulfilled by the server and the expected response has been achieved).
3xx – Redirection (The requested URL is redirected elsewhere).
4xx – Client Errors (This indicates that the page is not found).
5xx – Server Errors (A request made by the client but the server fails to complete the request).
As the HTML code is read, it will create a DOM.

DOM – Document Object Model
This is a model that represents all the attributes (text, links, images, etc.).
For each attribute, the browser sends a separate request to the server to fetch the resource, and then it is rendered.
Rendering means displaying it.

The browser sends a request, and the server gives an HTML resource as a response. This HTML resource will be converted into a DOM.

HTML BASICS
html
Copy
Edit
<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- This is a declaration -->
<html></html> <!-- This is used to write at the start and end of the document for declaration -->
<title> <!-- Self-explanatory -->
<body> <!-- Displays the elements in the body of the page -->
<img> <!-- Displays an image -->
<p> <!-- Displays a paragraph -->
<style> <!-- For styling using CSS -->
We can use classes:

html
Copy
Edit
<p class="username"> <!-- This is a classification, and any changes mentioning "username" will change only that particular class's elements -->
Now, the DOM looks like:

less
Copy
Edit
       html  
     /      \  
  head     body  
 /    \      |  
title   h1  img  
We can use DevTools provided by the web browser to adjust CSS and then apply it to the final code. This is handy and easy.

We use an HTML validator for fine-tuning the HTML file → @validator.w3
We use a CSS validator for fine-tuning the CSS sections → @Jigsaw CSS Validator

html
Copy
Edit
<a href="link"> <!-- This is to provide links (anchor elements) -->
